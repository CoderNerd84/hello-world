# hello-world
This repository is for a class project about learning to use GitHub.
My name is Luna. I am 40 years old, from Kentucky. I am the mom of a half German Shepard, half Belgian Malanois. She is the best dog I have ever had. 
I think coding will be hard but I am willing to face my fear and try it anyway!
